Hey
I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and developing new technologies, designing software applications for different platforms. I am pursuing Bachelors degree programs in Computer Science from University of Manitoba. I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment. I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality. In addition, I excel in my ability to work under pressure and handle stressful situations very well.
